<h3 align="center">Product Manager | AI & Data Products</h3>

<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋 Welcome to my GitHub</h1>

<p align="center">
I’m Abhiram Desai — a Product Manager who builds AI- and data-driven products through hands-on execution.

## 👋 About Me

I work at the intersection of **product strategy, AI systems, and analytics platforms**.  
This GitHub showcases **products built through code**, with a strong emphasis on product thinking, tradeoffs, and measurable impact.

The repositories here are meant to be read as **product case studies**, not just technical implementations.

###

## 🧭 What You’ll Find Here

- Product case studies grounded in real implementations  
- PRDs and product-thinking artifacts for AI, data, and platform products  
- Execution evidence used to validate product decisions  
- Projects focused on:
  - AI-enabled workflows and GenAI systems
  - Human-in-the-loop products
  - Analytics and decision-support platforms
  - Internal tools that improve operational efficiency

###

## 🧠 How to Read My Projects

Each repository is structured to answer:
- What problem does this product solve?
- Who is the target user?
- What tradeoffs were made?
- How is success measured?
- What would iteration look like post-launch?

Think of the code as **proof of execution**, not the product itself.
